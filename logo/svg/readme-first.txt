We provide our vector files in SVG
The SVG specification is an open standard that has been under development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.
But Adobe Illustrator  and Inkscape doesn't work with SVG according to W3C standards, unfortunately.
We can give advise to use software from this list  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics#Software_and_support_in_applications
